# hello-world
This is a test repo following the github hello-world tutorial; ensuring that indeed I can initialize a git repository on github.

I'm updating this readme file in following along with the github hello-world tutorial. I hope I can learn github effectively and that time spent to learned this knowledge as such doesn't betray me in future.
